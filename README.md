Design a GradeBook class which has a String data field representing the name of the
GradeBook, an int representing the number of tests associated with this GradeBook and
which contains a list of StudentResults.
 Add a constructor to the class which takes a parameter of type String representing
the name and an int value as a parameter which specifies the number of tests that
are associated with this GradeBook.
 Add a method void addStudentResult(String id, int testId,
double value).If the student id has already been added to the grade book then
insert the test result for this student. Otherwise add this student id and result to the
grade book.
 Add a method String toString()which returns a String containing the
student results of all students separated by an end of line character
